# BII Light Quality Initial Work
Two main RMarkdown files are in this repository:
- (IDENT-FAB Integrating Sphere) This file is for processing SVC data from the integrating spehere to reflectance values for both reflectance and transmittance measurements.
- (IDENT-FAB_Light_Analysis) This file is for processing in-situ canopy measurements and correcting for open field measurements.
